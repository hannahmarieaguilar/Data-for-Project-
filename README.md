# Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Review

## What is HCM? 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic cardiomyopathy with a prevalence of 1 in 500 in the general population. It is diagnosed phenotypically by abnormal thickening of the ventricular walls in the absence of abnormal loading conditions and the current criteria dictates that there is a wall thickness of greater than 15 mm in at least one LV myocardial segment, however in some cases 13mm of hypertrophy is sufficient for diagnosis. Patients with the disease often show symptoms including but not limited to arrythmia, chest pain, fatigue, fluttering or pounding feeling in the chest, and lightheadedness. Management of HCM is focused on symptom relief and reducing possible causes of heart failure.
